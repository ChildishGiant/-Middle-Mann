# Middle Mann

Lemme know watcha think. Ask me on Discord!: https://discord.gg/9QzHkQx

It clears the clutters and keeps the Shit.

In other words, this HUD moves everything to the center of your screen while keeping the default TF2 art style that we all SHOULD love. It's middle, & it's modern.

In other-other words, this is NOT another generic hud with random numbers floating at the centre of the screen. You weirdos.


Features Include:

    Health, ammo, and more moved closer to the middle of the screen
    Vanilla TF2 visuals
    Increased readability during intense fights
    Supports all resolutions (including 4:3, 16:9, 16:10, etc.)

Note: Does not work in minmode right now, please disable it from your advanced settings.
